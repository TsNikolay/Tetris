modules. Each module contains a class that describes a separate process,
creation of the game, its display, class-controller, which controls the whole process.

information about starting the game, creates a playing field, figures, controls their movement.
The View class is responsible for displaying the game, for its rendering and rendering.
And finally, the Controller class is responsible for the operation and interaction of classes between
